Matlab codes of Comparative study of truss sizing optimisation problem 2020

Codes of truss sizing optimisation problem with demo of optimisation algorithms,
SHAMODE and SHAMODE-WO are uploaded. The codes can be used as benchmark test problems
for developing single objective truss optimisation algorithms.
